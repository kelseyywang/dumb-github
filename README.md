# git-dumb

Have you ever accidentally merged away your diligent local changes and cried tears of frustration??
Or, are you tired of people stereotyping you as smart just because you're a programmer??
If so, it's time to **git dumb**.

### Introducing git-dumb, probably the best version control system you'll ever find.

It simply backs up different versions of files and stuff in your directory. The backups are plopped straight into that same directory and are categorized by the time they that they're captured! I haven't really used this yet but I'll bet it's great for use on sketchy hackathon projects, or when you're just feeling particularly dumb. I'll probably use it some day ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

How to use:

1.  Download this shit and put git-dumb.py in the same directory as the files you want to dumbly save.
2.  Run python3 git-dumb.py (or something like that) in that same directory.
3.  Modify files as you please. Enjoy!
