# Dumb GitHub

Does GitHub give you headaches, heartaches, and other bad feelings? Have you ever just wanted an incredibly inefficient and dumb version control system that just plops different versions of files in your local folder?

Me too!!!

### Introducing Dumb GitHub, one of my worse ideas.

How to use:

1.  Download this shit and put dumb_github.py in the same directory as the files you want to dumbly save.
2.  Run python3 dumb_github.py (or something like that) in that same directory.
3.  Enjoy!
