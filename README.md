# git-dumb

Are you tired of people stereotyping you as smart just because you're a programmer?
Have you ever accidentally merged away your diligent local changes and cried tears of frustration?
If so, it's time to **git dumb**.

### Introducing git-dumb, one of my worse ideas.

It's a "version control" system that just backs up different versions of files onto your local machine. Great for use on sketchy hackathon projects, or when you're just feeling particularly dumb. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

How to use:

1.  Download this shit and put git-dumb.py in the same directory as the files you want to dumbly save.
2.  Run python3 git-dumb.py (or something like that) in that same directory.
3.  Modify files as you please. Enjoy!
